# Work-Day-Scheduler

Client asked for a business day planner to facilitate ease of daily activity. To accomplish this we relied upon an index file formatted with Bootstrap, but more heavily on Javascript and JQuery to power that page. Utilizing the styles provided by the client, we have met all client requirements as outlined below:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist


The finished project will appear as shown below
